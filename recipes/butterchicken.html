    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken, traditionally known as Murgh makhani, is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. 
      Its sauce is known for its rich texture. In addition sometimes the cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture.It originated in 
      the Indian subcontinent as a curry. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curry was developed in the 1950s by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral, founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi, India.
      The curry was made "by chance" by mixing leftover tandoori chicken in a tomato gravy, rich in butter (makhan).In 1974, a recipe was published 
      for "Murgh makhanii (Tandoori chicken cooked in butter and tomato sauce)". In 1975, the English phrase "butter chicken" curry first appeared 
      in print, as a specialty of the house at Gaylord Indian restaurant in Manhattan. In Toronto and the Caribbean, it can be found as a filling in 
      pizza, poutine, wraps, roti, or rolls, while in Australia, and New Zealand, it is also eaten as a pie filling.The curry is common in India and 
      many other countries.
